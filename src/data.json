It's about three sisters from a family of forest witches. I hope you'll check it out at www.sylvaniacomic.com !!!\n\n**************\nSVA 2013!!!\n\nI wanted to make sure I wouldn't get tired of working on my thesis film halfway through the year, so I made sure to throw in all of my favorite things. This is the result: my ode to merpeople, schoolchildren with magical secrets, the color aqua, and of course, hermit crabs. I hope you like it too!!!\n\nMusic by Clark Powell: http://clarkpowell.bandcamp.com/\n\nExtra special thanks go to my parents for their inexhaustible love and support, to all my coloring minions for their hard work, and especially to my 4th floor bros for being so totally rad. I LOVE YOU ALL\n\ncontact: kecky415@gmail",
